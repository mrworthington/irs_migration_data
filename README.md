# IRS SOI Data Retrieval with Docker + R

This is a repo that downloads and organizes population migration data from the IRS' Statistics of Income Population Migration data for consumption into a Quarto Dashboard

For information on the data organized, here's a description from the IRS' page about this data:

> U.S. Population Migration Data
Migration data for the United States are based on year-to-year address changes reported on individual income tax returns filed with the IRS. They present migration patterns by State or by county for the entire United States and are available for inflows—the number of new residents who moved to a State or county and where they migrated from, and outflows—the number of residents leaving a State or county and where they went. The data are available for Filing Years 1991 through 2022 and include:

> * Number of returns filed, which approximates the number of households that migrated
> * Number of personal exemptions claimed, which approximates the number of individuals
> * Total adjusted gross income, starting with Filing Year 1995
> * Aggregate migration flows at the State level, by the size of adjusted gross income (AGI) and age of the primary taxpayer, starting with Filing Year 2011.

> **Important:** Beginning with data for 2011–2012, SOI has introduced a number of enhancements to improve the data’s overall quality, as well as provide a new series of information. For more information, see “SOI Migration Data: A New Approach PDF.”
